Silly Examples and Jokes Using PowerShell

The purpose of this repo is to collect silly examples of using PowerShell to describe various things from movies, music, and literature.

Please feel free to provide ideas and also share them on twitter using the hashtag #poshfun

This all originated several years back when a few folks in the community decided to get ridiculous using some powershell. 
I posted a few of those early examples at http://www.vtesseract.com/post/16504534554/more-poshfun-join-us

Looking forward to your contributions!
